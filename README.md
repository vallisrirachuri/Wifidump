## üìå Features
- Lists all saved Wi-Fi SSIDs on your Windows machine.  
- Retrieves corresponding passwords (if stored).  
- Skips networks without saved keys.  
- Error handling for missing or restricted profiles.

## ‚úÖ Pros
- Simple and lightweight script (no external libraries needed).  
- Works directly with built-in Windows commands.  
- Useful for recovering forgotten Wi-Fi passwords.  
- Easy to understand and modify.  

---

## ‚ùå Cons
- Works **only on Windows** (Linux/Mac not supported).  
- Requires appropriate permissions (sometimes *Administrator*).  
- Passwords are shown in plain text (security concern if misused).  
- Relies on `netsh`, so formatting changes in Windows may break regex.
